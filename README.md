A Simple Customer Webapp has been developed for a client who is very concerned for their customers Privacy and safety online. Unfortunately the work which was developed has been magically corrupted somehow and there are some clear issues in the consistency, privacy and functionality of the application. You've been tasked to speedrun the fixes because we need to deploy this app to our client asap, time is money here. 

We want to make sure that there are no privacy issues, strange inconsistencies or errors before we deploy. You may use any resources you wish; code comments, documentation, stack overflow. This is an individual activity to test your personal skills, if you wish to reveal anything to anyone else, that's up to you. 

Once you believe you're done, click the complete challenge button which will communicate with the backend and verify that you've completed everything correctly. If everything checks out you'll get confirmation and your time will be noted.
